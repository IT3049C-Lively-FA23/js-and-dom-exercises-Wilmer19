## Self-Evaluation: 
(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I deserve 20/20 because all of my unit tests passed.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
I learned that it's important to understand the difference between "document.getElementById" and "document.getElementByIds".
I was having trouble understanding why my code wasn't working. I found out that "stat" only had one ID which meant I needed 
to use "document.getElementById".

### How long it took you to finish this?
It took me around 2 hours to complete this assignment.
